\begin{abstract}

Pension systems play a very crucial role in the economic 
and political development of countries and help to maintain purchasing power for decades. Nevertheless, many people do not have access to good pension systems. That's why 
we propose the development of a blockchain-based, decentralized and globally available pay-as-you-go pension system. We show how redistribution of contributions towards pension payments works and how voluntary participation in the pension system is incentivized through transparent, fair and unchangeable processes. Creating a premium for the last generation of the pay-as-you-go system ensures that all participants receive a pension and, in addition, creates an incentive to participate in the pension system.
