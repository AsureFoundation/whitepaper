\section{Challenges}

Depending on the social security system, there are various variables such as mass payments and mass disbursements that can minimize the transaction volume on the main chain and would enable the transition to the side chain. This special requirement concerns the design of the social insurances which are in our focus and our goal is to solve it.

The world is becoming more and more global, people enjoy more freedom and need solutions that work globally and simplify life.

Further social insurance models are being researched to achieve the best possible results in terms of fairness, transparency, trust, awareness and acceptance for the community.
