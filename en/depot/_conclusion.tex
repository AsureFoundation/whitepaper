\section{Summary}

This work had as its goal solving the listed problems with a decentralized approach as well as to show how a social security system can work in the future.

Thanks to public's voluntary participation, the invention of the incentives that makes the system a very interesting alternative became possible. A start for a transparent, fair and barrier-free pension that can be used worldwide.


If everyone adheres to the same rules, the only thing that occurs is that the system store the purchasing power. Without any influence of inflation or deflation in economics, the same number of $Units$ paid into the system will be paid out to users. Therefore there is no profit and no loss, but the value retention was simply being kept for years. \footnote{ The only costs incurred will be the transaction costs, in case of a private network, these can be further minimized.}

It is assumed that some users will opt for an earlier pension, even if it means partial loss for a user. Some users will lose full access to the system because e.g. the private key is lost, the pension contributions are not inherited and not collected. After some time, the paid-in values will be released, which will benefit the other users in the system.
